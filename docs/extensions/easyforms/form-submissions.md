## 1. Viewing Submissions in the Administrator

1. Log into the **Joomla Administrator**.
2. Go to **Components → EasyForms → Submissions**.
3. Use the filter to select a specific form, if needed.
4. You’ll see a list of submissions, including:
   - Submission date and time.
   - Basic summary fields (e.g., name, email) if configured.

Click a submission to open its full details.

## 2. Filtering and Searching

Use the filters at the top of the submissions list to:

- Restrict results to a **date range** (today, this week, custom dates).
- Filter by **status** (new, processed, archived), if your setup uses statuses.
- Search by **keyword**, such as an email address or name.

Filtering helps you efficiently process submissions in batches.

## 3. Exporting Submissions

To analyze data in tools like Excel or Google Sheets:

1. In the submissions list, look for an **Export** button.
2. Select the desired **format** (commonly CSV or Excel).
3. Choose whether to export **all submissions** or only those matching current filters.
4. Download the file and open it in your preferred tool.

For very large datasets, export in date-based chunks.

## 4. Working with Submissions

Depending on configuration, you may be able to:

- Mark submissions as **processed**, **contacted**, or **archived**.
- Add **internal notes** (viewable only by admins).
- Print or save submissions as PDFs.

These features help your team coordinate follow-up and record-keeping.

## 5. Frontend Submission Views

If your site uses frontend management, you might also:

- View submissions from the frontend "My Submissions" area.
- Apply similar filtering and viewing actions with a simplified interface.

Check [Frontend Form Management](./frontend-management) for details.
