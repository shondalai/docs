## 1. Creating a New Form

1. Log into the **Joomla Administrator**.
2. Go to **Components → EasyForms → Forms**.
3. Click **New**.
4. Enter a **Form Title** (e.g., "Contact Us", "Event Registration").
5. Optionally choose a **Form Type** (form, survey, quiz, poll) if available.
6. Click **Save** to create the form, then open the **Form Builder** tab.

You now see the drag-and-drop builder with a live preview of your form.

## 2. Understanding the Form Builder Screen

The builder typically has three main areas:

- **Preview canvas** – the center area showing how your form looks.
- **Field sidebar** – a library of fields you can add (text, email, dropdown, etc.).
- **Toolbar** – actions like settings, AI Assistant, preview, conditional logic, and save.

You can click any field in the preview to edit its settings.

## 3. Adding and Configuring Fields

### Adding Fields

1. In the **Field sidebar**, browse available field types:
   - **Basic**: Text, Email, Phone, Number, Textarea
   - **Choices**: Dropdown, Radio buttons, Checkboxes, Multi-select
   - **Date & Time**: Date, Time, Datetime
   - **File & Media**: File upload, Image upload, Signature
   - **Advanced**: Address, Rating, Calculation, Hidden, etc.
2. Drag a field into the form preview or click it to add it at the bottom.

### Configuring Field Settings

Click a field in the preview to open its settings panel. Common options include:

- **Label** – the question or name shown above the field.
- **Placeholder** – faint example text inside the field.
- **Help text** – explanation or instructions below the field.
- **Required** – whether the field must be filled in.
- **Default value** – pre-filled value (optional).
- **Options** – for dropdown, radio, and checkbox fields (e.g., "Yes", "No").

Make changes and they appear instantly in the preview.

## 4. Organizing Sections and Layout

### Grouping Fields into Sections

For longer forms, group related questions:

1. Add **Section** or **Heading** fields to visually separate parts of the form.
2. Use clear titles like "Personal Information" or "Preferences".

### Using Columns (If Supported)

Many layouts support multiple columns:

- Drag fields side by side to create two- or three-column layouts.
- Use columns for short fields (first/last name, city/postcode) to save space.

Always preview on mobile to ensure fields are still easy to use.

## 5. Form Settings (Global Options)

In the builder toolbar or a "Form Settings" panel, you can configure:

- **Title and description** displayed on the form.
- **Form type** (form, survey, quiz, poll), if supported.
- **Submission behavior**:
  - Show a success message.
  - Redirect to a thank-you page.
  - Hide the form after submission.
- **Multi-page options** (progress bar, step titles) when using page breaks.
- **Custom CSS** for advanced styling (optional).

These settings affect the entire form, not individual fields.

## 6. Previewing and Testing Your Form

1. Click **Preview** in the builder toolbar.
2. A preview opens (often in a new tab).
3. Test your form as a visitor would:
   - Fill in fields and submit.
   - Check required fields and error messages.
   - Try on both desktop and mobile.

If anything looks wrong, go back to the builder, adjust fields or settings, and preview again.

## 7. When to Use the AI Form Builder Assistant

If you know what you want to collect but don’t want to design every field manually, use the **AI Form Builder Assistant**:

- Describe your form in plain language.
- Let AI propose fields and structure.
- Apply suggestions, then fine-tune in the builder.

Read the dedicated guide: [AI Form Builder Assistant](./ai-form-builder).

## 8. Next Steps

After building your form, you’ll likely want to:

- Configure **confirmation and notification emails** – see [Email Notifications and Autoresponders](./emails).
- Add **conditional logic** to show/hide fields dynamically – see [Conditional Logic and Smart Forms](./conditional-logic).
- **Publish** your form on your site – see [Publishing Forms on Your Site](./publishing-forms).
