## 1. What You Can Learn from Analytics

EasyForms analytics (depending on configuration) can show:

- Total submissions for each form.
- Conversion rate (how many visitors submitted the form).
- Completion rates for multi-page forms.
- Trends over time (daily, weekly, monthly).
- Device and platform breakdowns (desktop vs mobile, browser types).

These insights help you improve form design and measure campaign performance.

## 2. Accessing Analytics

1. In the **Joomla Administrator**, go to **Components → EasyForms**.
2. Click **Analytics** or open analytics from within a specific form.
3. Select the **form** and **date range** you want to analyze.

You may see multiple tabs or sections, such as **Overview**, **Submissions**, **Conversion**, **Audience**, **Devices**, or **Trends**.

---

## 3. Reading Key Metrics

- **Submissions** – total number of completed forms.
- **Conversion Rate** – percentage of visitors who submitted.
- **Drop-off points** – pages or questions where users most often abandon a multi-page form.
- **Device Breakdown** – e.g., 70% mobile, 30% desktop.

Use these metrics to:

- Identify forms with lots of views but low conversion (candidates for simplification).
- Spot device-specific issues if conversion is much lower on mobile.

---

## 4. Improving Your Forms Based on Analytics

- Simplify or shorten forms with low conversion.
- Move critical fields earlier in the form.
- Fix confusing questions that cause drop-offs.
- Adjust design or spacing if mobile users struggle.

Make small changes and recheck analytics after a period of time.

## 5. Exporting or Sharing Reports

You can:

- Take screenshots of key analytics views for reports.
- Export data or metrics if your EasyForms version supports it.

For deeper analysis across your entire site, consider connecting to an external analytics tool (see the next guide).
