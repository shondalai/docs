## 1. Joomla Multilingual Basics

Before working with multilingual forms, ensure that:

- Multiple languages are installed and enabled in Joomla.
- Content languages and the language filter plugin are configured.
- Menus and modules are assigned to appropriate languages.

Your Joomla administrator typically handles this setup.

## 2. Approaches to Multilingual Forms

You can manage multilingual forms in one of two common ways:

1. **Separate forms per language**
   - Create one form for each language (e.g., "Contact Us (EN)", "Contactez-nous (FR)").
   - Publish each form on language-specific menu items.

2. **Single form with translations** (if supported)
   - Use EasyForms’ multilingual options to translate labels and messages within the same form.
   - The form dynamically displays the correct language based on the page.

Check which approach is supported and recommended for your EasyForms version.

## 3. Using AI Translation (If Enabled)

If AI Translation is configured by your administrator, you can use it to speed up translation work.

Typical workflow:

1. Edit the form in the **Form Builder**.
2. Navigate to the translation or language settings for the form or a specific field.
3. Use an **AI Translate** button or option (if available) to generate translations of labels and messages.
4. Review and adjust translations for accuracy and tone.

AI helps, but human review is still important.

## 4. Testing Multilingual Forms

1. Switch your site’s language from the frontend (using a language switcher module).
2. Visit the pages containing your forms.
3. Confirm that:
   - Form labels, buttons, and messages appear in the correct language.
   - Redirects and confirmation pages are also localized.

If something appears in the wrong language, check menu assignments and form translations.
