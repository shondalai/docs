## 1. Using Built-In Themes

EasyForms typically includes built-in themes that control colors, borders, and basic typography.

### Selecting a Theme

1. Open your form in the **Form Builder**.
2. Look for a **Theme**, **Design**, or **Appearance** tab.
3. Choose from available themes (light, dark, minimal, etc.).
4. Save and preview your form.

Themes help your forms look good out-of-the-box without manual styling.

## 2. Adjusting Layout

### Sections and Headings

- Use **Section** or **Heading** fields to break the form into logical parts.
- Clear headings make long forms easier to navigate.

### Columns (If Supported)

- Place related short fields side by side (e.g., First Name / Last Name, City / Postcode).
- Avoid putting very long fields (like big textareas) into narrow columns.

Always test your form on mobile devices; multi-column layouts should gracefully stack on small screens.

## 3. Template Gallery

If your EasyForms installation includes a template gallery:

1. When creating a new form, choose **From Template** instead of starting from blank.
2. Browse templates such as:
   - Contact form
   - Newsletter signup
   - Event registration
   - Feedback survey
3. Select a template and customize fields, text, and settings as needed.

Templates are a great way to follow best practices without starting from scratch.

## 4. Custom CSS (Advanced)

If you’re comfortable with CSS, you can fine-tune the look and feel.

1. Edit your form and open **Form Settings**.
2. Look for a **Custom CSS** or **Advanced** section.
3. Add CSS rules that target your form elements.

Examples:

- Adjust spacing between fields.
- Change button colors.
- Hide optional labels or help text in special layouts.

Be careful—poorly written CSS can affect other parts of your site. Test changes thoroughly.

## 5. Consistency Tips

- Use similar styles and structures across forms so visitors know what to expect.
- Keep headings and button labels consistent (e.g., always use "Submit" or "Send" rather than mixing terms).
- Avoid overly bright or clashing colors that harm readability.
