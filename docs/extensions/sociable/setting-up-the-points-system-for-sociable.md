## Introduction

Sociable has a built-in points system that allows your users to get rewarded for various activities on your site. You can configure the points for each activity available. The points can be earned within the Sociable component through many actions such as posting status, creating a topic in groups, etc. The points can also be earned from the actions performed on other Joomla! extensions such as CjForum etc. For example, if you run a forum using CjForum component, you can reward your user for posting topics, like/dislike topics, etc.

Sociable points system is flexible. You can use the built-in points system or use supported third party points systems. When you use a third-party points system, the points for the activities on Sociable will be posted to the selected system.
