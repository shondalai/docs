Ranking questions allow users to compare the answers by drag-and-drop and placing them in order of their preference. In Community Surveys, you can give weightage to each answer apart from the ordering weightage chosen by the user. While displaying the consolidated report, the order of the answers chosen by the user and their weightages are considered in showing the charts.

Here is the formula used to calculate the preference totals of each answer.

Distribution of Ranks (for an answer):

Rank Percentage = Number of votes received for the rank * Rank Weightage

The report will display the bar chart with the above percentage distribution of all ranks of an answer. An example is shown below.

The score will be calculated by adding up all ranks scores.
