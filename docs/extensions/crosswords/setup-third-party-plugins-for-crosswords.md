## Configuring JomSocial Plugin

The JomSocial plugin is bundled with the main component. So you need not install anything separately. However, to use the user points functionality, please follow the below steps.

- Go to JomSocial->User Points on your Administration Control Panel components
- Click on Rule Scan button on toolbar.
- This will install the rules for awarding points when the user submit questions as well as when a user solved the crossword. Please configure the points as you wish.

After configuring the plugin under JomSocial, you need to enable points system and JomSocial points options under Crosswords Configuration.

- This will install the rules for awarding points when the user submit questions as well as when a user solved the crossword. Please configure the points as you wish.
