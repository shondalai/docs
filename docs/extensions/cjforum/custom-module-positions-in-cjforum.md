CjForum comes with some predefined module positions which allow you to embed any of your modules such as advertisements into them. Since standard module positions in Joomla does not give you enough freedom to embed your modules into the actual component content, CjForum defines its own module positions. They are explained below.

## In Forums (Index) page

**forums-view-after-forum-X-Y:** where X is the section number, Y is the forum number. e.g. forums-view-after-forum-1-1 will load after first forum in the first section.
**forum-categories-above-toolbar:** display the module above the toolbar on category pages

## In topics listings

**topics-view-after-topic-X:** where X is the topic position. e.g. topics-view-after-topic-1 will load your module after the first topic in the list.
**topics-list-above-toolbar:** display the module above the toolbar on topics list pages

## In topic details page

**topic-view-after-reply-X:** where X is the reply position. e.g. topic-view-after-reply-1 will load your module after the first reply in the topic on every topic details page.
**topic-view-above-reply-form:** display the modules above the topic reply form
**topic-view-below-reply-form:** display the modules below the topic reply form
**topic-view-above-replies:** display the modules above the topic replies

## In profile page

**profile-view-above-summary:** loads your module just before the summary (below the avatar)
